Setup
--------------------------

To set up your environment, follow these instructions:

If you donâ€™t have postgresql installed, you can get it here: http://postgresapp.com
If you see issues (now or later) related to libssl or libcrypto, try setting up symbolic links with these two lines. This worked for us:
  sudo ln -s /Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.4/lib/libssl.1.0.0.dylib /usr/lib
  sudo ln -s /Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.4/lib/libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib /usr/lib


To install our dependencies:
   easy_install pip
   pip install virtualenv
   virtualenv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt


To setup the database (which should result in 1231 records for accepted loans and 1998 for rejected loans)
   createdb pythia_dev
   python manage.py db upgrade
   python init_test_db.py

How to run our code
---------------------------------

All of our code is run from the file pythia.py. The syntax to call it is:
python pythia.py <test_type> -n <num_iterations> -m <num_samples> -t <num_trees>

We solved three problems:
1. Accept - Will a loan be accepted
2. Grade - What grade will be assigned to the loan
3. Quality - Will the loan be paid back or defaulted on

The test types are: [accept, grade, grade_logit, quality]. 
For grade, we have two implementations. If you use the test_type "grade", you will use the random forest regressor. If you use test_type "grade_logit", you'll use the ordinal logit

For the other parameters, they have default values if you don't set them. They are:
 - Number iterations = 1
 - Number samples = 1000
 - Number trees = 16

So, if you want to test our program on the acceptance algorithm with 10 trees, 500 samples, and 2 iterations, you can do:
  python pythia.py accept -n 2 -m 500 -t 10

This will print separate results from 2 runs, each of which will contain a score and an OOB score.

So if you want to test all of our implementations with 500 samples across 2 iterations, with 10 trees for each of the random forest algorithms, you can do:
   python pythia.py accept -n 2 -m 500 -t 10
   python pythia.py grade -n 2 -m 500 -t 10
   python pythia.py grade_logit -n 2 -m 500
   python pythia.py quality -n 2 -m 500 -t 10
